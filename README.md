# PeKo: Precondition Knowledge Dataset

## Overview
PeKo (**P**r**e**condition **K**n**o**wledge) is a large scale crowdsourced event precondition knowledge dataset introduced in our paper _Modeling Preconditions in Text with a Crowd-sourced Dataset_ at EMNLP Findings 2020 

Preprint coming soon.

## Crowdsourcing Precondition Knowledge
We extract events and their temporal relations from news articles using CAEVO ([Chambers et al., 2014](https://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/nchamber/caevo/)), a temporal relation extraction system. We used CAEVO on a random sample of 6,837 articles inthe New York Times Annotated Corpus ([Sandhaus, 2008](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19)). 
On average CAEVO extracted around 63 events per article, which yielded a total of 3,906 possible relation candidates per document. We filtered these to retain only pairs of events that have a BEFORE or AFTER temporal relation between them. We call the temporally preceding event the _candidate precondition_, and the temporally subsequent event in the pair the _target event_.

The annotators were presented with a text snippet and two event mentions highlighted as shown below. To prune out event extraction errors from CAEVO, the annotators were first asked if the highlighted text denoted valid events. If both triggers were deemed valid, then the annotators evaluated whether or not the candidate precondition event was an actual precondition for the target event. Specifically they check if the candidate event is necessary for the target event to happen.
